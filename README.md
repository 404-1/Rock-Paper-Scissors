# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Classic game of Rock, Papers and Scissors in Python

## How does it work?

1. **Choose your move:** Pick Rock, Paper, or Scissors and see what the computer chooses.
2. **Determine the winner:** The game follows the standard rules - Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. The game then declares the winner based on the choices made.
3. **Try again/exit loop:** After a winner is declared, the game asks if you want to play again or exit, and does accordingly based on the selected option.

## Why did I build it?

This project helped me reinforce my understanding of conditionals, loops, and handling user input.

## How to get started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-paper-scissors.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd rock-paper-scissors
   ```
3. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```

## Challenges I faced

Ensuring the game could correctly interpret and respond to different user inputs (including invalid ones) was the biggest challenge I encountered, specifically at the last input request to handle the wrong inputs, try again inputs, and exit inputs.

So when going through the code, try to understand that I’m at the point where I’m glad it works :)
